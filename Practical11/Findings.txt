Intepretations
The sequences of humans and cats are most closely related. The sequences of cats and mouses are least closely related. The sequences of humans and mouses are modestly closely related.

These data provide insight into the evolutionary relationships and genetic similarities between these species. 
The lower alignment score and higher percentage of identical amino acids between humans and cats may suggest that these species have undergone less genetic divergence since they may share a more recent common ancestor than either species wih mices, 
while the higher alignmnet and lower percentage for cat-mouse comparisons may indicate a longer evolutionary distance and a greater degree of divergence between these species .
